# Rust Ecommerce

This is a simple ecommerce application built with Rust for learning purposes.

## Running

To run the application, you need to have Rust installed. You can install it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then, you can run the application with:

```bash
cargo run
```

The project uses [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) for command execution instead of Make. You can install it with:

```bash
cargo install just
```

Then, you can run the application with:

```bash
just run:dev # cargo watch -x run
```
